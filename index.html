            <p class="sectionsubTag text-sm">Computer science education or computing education is the science and art of teaching and learning of computer science, computing and computational thinking.As a subdiscipline of pedagogy it also addresses the wider impact of computer science in society through its intersection with philosophy, psychology, linguistics, natural sciences, and mathematics. In comparison to science education and mathematics education, computer science (CS) education is a much younger field.In the history of computing, digital computers were only built from around the 1940s â€“ although computation has been around for centuries since the invention of analog computers.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-sm">In many countries, there is a significant gender gap in computer science education. In 2015, 15.3% of computer science students graduating from non-doctoral granting institutions in the US were women while at doctoral granting institutions, the figure was 16.6%.The number of female PhD recipients in the US was 19.3% in 2018.The gender gap also exists in other western countries.The gap is smaller, or nonexistent, in some parts of the world. In 2011, women earned half of the computer science degrees in Malaysia.In 2001, 55 percent of computer science graduates in Guyana were women.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-sm">Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by designing/building an executable computer program. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language, commonly referred to as coding).The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit.</p>
